# Advent of Code

Hello! Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! Here I post my solutions to [Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com).

One of my goals of doing Advent of Code is to learn a new language, so if the languages I use for AoC are wonky, that's why.
Here's a quicklink to each year I participated:
- [2022](/2022): Rust, Haskell
- [2023](/2023): Rust, OCaml
